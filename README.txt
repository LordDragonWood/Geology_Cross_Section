This Excel App was created for a geology company to replace their existing company worksheets and logging for oil wells.

The app was created by me (Dragon Wood) on my own computer, on my own time. It was tested with real data from wells I worked on.

The company owner liked the app, but ultimately opted not to use it. I later left the company and took it with me.

No changes have been made since I showed it to the owner in 2011.

It is here as part of my portfolio to demonstrate how I develop software. Regardless of this being a MS Excel file. It is the macros that made it more functional than a simple Excel workbook.

There is company information within the app, but none of it is private.

The app password is included in the code, but since this is the only thing that password was ever used for, I didn't see a reason to change it.

If you are a VBA developer and wish to use my code in your project, please do. A comment within your code identifying the source and/or a thank you would be appreciated, but is not required.

If you see places where I could have been more efficient with my code, or if you find code within the app that I did not post seperately, please let me know.
